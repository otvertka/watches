      "description": "A very attractive example of the yellow gold Nautilus 3700/1J. The case remains in excellent condition, lightly polished in the past, showing only minimal wear while retaining strong proportions. The original blue tritium dial is in excellent condition with no visible defects. The hands are original, with a slight difference in the lume on the hour hand due to an old repair. The original wide yellow gold bracelet is in excellent condition with minimal stretch and retains its original clasp. Accompanied by an Extract from the Archives confirming production in 1979 and sale on June 16, 1980. The movement has been fully checked by our watchmaker and is in perfect working order. A clean and honest example of the iconic Nautilus 3700/1J — a reference that remains one of the most elegant and sought-after precious metal Nautilus models.",
